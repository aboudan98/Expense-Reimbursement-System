# Expense-Reimbursement-System

The Expense Reimbursement System (ERS) will manage the process of reimbursing employees for expenses incurred while on company time. All employees in the company can log in and submit requests for reimbursements and view their past tickets and pending requests. Managers can log in and view all reimbursement requests and past history for all employees in the company. Managers are authorized to approve and deny requests for expense reimbursements.
